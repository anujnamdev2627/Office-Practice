@ Date-[07/01/2026]{ 
- JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
- The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
- ECMAScript	JavaScript
    Specification	Programming language
    Defines syntax & behavior	Implements the spec
- JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.
- Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
- Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or the CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.
- When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”

Safety Limitations->
- JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote side. Once again, that’s a safety limitation.

There are at least three great things about JavaScript->
- Full integration with HTML/CSS.
- Simple things are done simply.
- Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.

Languages “over” JavaScript->
- CoffeeScript is “syntactic sugar” for JavaScript. It introduces shorter syntax, allowing us to write clearer and more precise code. Usually, Ruby devs like it.
- TypeScript is concentrated on adding “strict data typing” to simplify the development and support of complex systems. It is developed by Microsoft.
- Flow also adds data typing, but in a different way. Developed by Facebook.
- Dart is a standalone language that has its own engine that runs in non-browser environments (like mobile apps), but also can be transpiled to JavaScript. Developedby  Google.
- Brython is a Python transpiler to JavaScript that enables the writing of applications in pure Python without JavaScript.
- Kotlin is a modern, concise and safe programming language that can target the browser or Node.

Specification->
- The ECMA-262 specification contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about JavaScript. It defines the language.
- JavaScript is already present in most IDEs because it is the default, standardized language of the web and modern development ecosystems.

What is the Developer Console?->
- The Developer Console is a built-in tool in browsers that lets developers inspect, debug, and interact with JavaScript running on a web page.

- Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.

Comments->
 - // Single line
 - /* */ MultiLine Comments

The modern mode, "use strict"->
-  What is "use strict"?
"use strict" enables Strict Mode in JavaScript, which makes the language more strict, safer, and less error-prone.

Variables->
- let – is a modern variable declaration.
- var – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all, but we’ll cover subtle differences from let in the chapter The old "var", just in case you need them.
- const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.

Data Types->
- here are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

Seven primitive data types:
    number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
    bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
    string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
    boolean for true/false.
    null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
    undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
    symbol for unique identifiers.

And one non-primitive data type:
    object for more complex data structures.


Summary->
- JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but it is now used in many other environments as well.
- Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted browser language, fully integrated with HTML/CSS.
- There are many languages that get “transpiled” to JavaScript and provide certain features. It is recommended to take a look at them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.

@Date[08/01/2026]{

- The unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator + applied to a single value, doesn’t do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.

- Fot the ">,<" operator if both operands are strings, JavaScript compares them lexicographically (dictionary order), not numerically.

- Short-circuit evaluation.

- Another feature of OR || operator is the so-called “short-circuit” evaluation.
It means that || processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the other argument.     

- Transpilers ->
A transpiler is a special piece of software that translates source code to another source code. It can parse (“read and understand”) modern code and rewrite it using older syntax constructs, so that it’ll also work in outdated engines.
- Polyfills
New language features may include not only syntax constructs and operators, but also built-in functions.
A script that updates/adds new functions is called “polyfill”. It “fills in” the gap and adds missing implementations.

- Computed properties
We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That’s called computed properties.

@Date[09/01/2026]{
-Symbols are guaranteed to be unique. Even if we create many symbols with exactly the same description, they are different values. The description is just a label that doesn’t affect anything.

- There are 3 types (hints) of it:
"string" (for alert and other operations that need a string)
"number" (for maths)
"default" (few operators, usually objects implement it the same way as "number")

String Methods->
 -str.indexOf,includes, startsWith, endsWith
 -There are 3 methods in JavaScript to get a substring: substring, substr and slice.
 -slice(start, end)	from start to end (not including end)	allows negatives
 -substring(start, end)	between start and end (not including end)	negative values mean 0
 -substr(start, length)	from start get length characters	allows negative start

-Array.from
  There’s a universal method Array.from that takes an iterable or array-like value and makes a “real” Array from it. Then we can call array methods on it.

-Map
Map is a collection of keyed data items, just like an Object. But the main difference is that Map allows keys of any type.

In the examples above variables were declared right in the assignment: let {…} = {…}. Of course, we could use existing variables too, without let. But there’s a catch.

This won’t work:

let title, width, height;

// error in this line
{title, width, height} = {title: "Menu", width: 200, height: 100};
The problem is that JavaScript treats {...} in the main code flow (not inside another expression) as a code block. Such code blocks can be used to group statements, like this:

{
  // a code block
  let message = "Hello";
  // ...
  alert( message );
}
So here JavaScript assumes that we have a code block, that’s why there’s an error. We want destructuring instead.

To show JavaScript that it’s not a code block, we can wrap the expression in parentheses (...):

let title, width, height;

// okay now
({title, width, height} = {title: "Menu", width: 200, height: 100});

alert( title ); // Menu


getTimezoneOffset()
Returns the difference between UTC and the local time zone, in minutes:

- > Transparent caching
Let’s say we have a function slow(x) which is CPU-heavy, but its results are stable. In other words, for the same x it always returns the same result.

If the function is called often, we may want to cache (remember) the results to avoid spending extra-time on recalculations.

But instead of adding that functionality into slow() we’ll create a wrapper function, that adds caching. As we’ll see, there are many benefits of doing so.

{

That label affects its behavior with new.

When a regular function is executed with new, it creates an empty object and assigns it to this.
But when a derived constructor runs, it doesn’t do this. It expects the parent constructor to do this job.
So a derived constructor must call super in order to execute its parent (base) constructor, otherwise the object for this won’t be created. And we’ll get an error.

For the Rabbit constructor to work, it needs to call super() before using this, like here:
}

That’s their implementation of toString. But there’s a hidden feature that makes toString actually much more powerful than that. We can use it as an extended typeof and an alternative for instanceof.
